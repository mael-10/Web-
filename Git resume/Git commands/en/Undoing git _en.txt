So if we make a mistake? What if we accidentally add or 
or commit something wrong?

Add: 

1- Git reset file_name (When you are undoing your add)
Or just use reset.

The reset will undo previous files

Commit

git reset HEAD~1

That command tells git insteading do point to previous commit, point one commit futher
meaning it will completely undo the commit that i just made

But if you have many differents commits: 

1- git log 
2- Copy the hash 
3- Git reset hash_code

git reset --hard hash_code
meaning i want of the changes to not just be unstaged
but completely removed

After that use:

git push --force
